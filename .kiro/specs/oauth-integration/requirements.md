# OAuth Integration Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating OAuth authentication (Google and Apple Sign-In) into the Awesome Mail application. The integration will provide users with convenient single sign-on options while maintaining the existing email/password authentication system. This enhancement will improve user onboarding experience and reduce friction in the authentication process across all supported platforms (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Web).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Google OAuth Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with my Google account, so that I can quickly access the app without creating a new password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps "Sign in with Google" THEN the system SHALL initiate Google OAuth flow
2. WHEN Google OAuth is successful THEN the system SHALL create or link a user account automatically
3. WHEN Google OAuth fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry
4. WHEN a user signs in with Google for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a new account using Google profile information
5. WHEN a user with existing email/password account signs in with Google THEN the system SHALL link the accounts if emails match
6. WHEN Google OAuth is completed THEN the system SHALL store OAuth tokens securely for future API access

### Requirement 2: Apple Sign-In Integration

**User Story:** As an iOS/macOS user, I want to sign in with Apple ID, so that I can use the app seamlessly within the Apple ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps "Sign in with Apple" THEN the system SHALL initiate Apple Sign-In flow
2. WHEN Apple Sign-In is successful THEN the system SHALL create or link a user account automatically
3. WHEN Apple Sign-In fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry
4. WHEN a user signs in with Apple for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a new account using Apple ID information
5. WHEN a user chooses to hide their email THEN the system SHALL handle Apple's private relay email appropriately
6. WHEN Apple Sign-In is completed THEN the system SHALL store necessary tokens securely

### Requirement 3: Cross-Platform OAuth Support

**User Story:** As a user on any platform, I want OAuth sign-in to work consistently, so that I have the same experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth is implemented THEN it SHALL work on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Web platforms
2. WHEN a user switches platforms THEN their OAuth-linked account SHALL work seamlessly across devices
3. WHEN platform-specific OAuth features are available THEN they SHALL be utilized appropriately (e.g., Apple Sign-In on iOS/macOS)
4. WHEN OAuth is not available on a platform THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to email/password authentication

### Requirement 4: Account Linking and Management

**User Story:** As a user with multiple sign-in methods, I want my accounts to be properly linked, so that I can access my data regardless of how I sign in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in with OAuth using an email that matches an existing account THEN the system SHALL link the OAuth provider to the existing account
2. WHEN account linking occurs THEN the user SHALL be notified of the successful link
3. WHEN a user has multiple OAuth providers linked THEN they SHALL be able to sign in with any of them
4. WHEN a user wants to unlink an OAuth provider THEN the system SHALL provide this option in account settings
5. WHEN unlinking would leave no authentication method THEN the system SHALL require setting up an alternative method first

### Requirement 5: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my OAuth authentication to be secure and respect my privacy, so that my personal information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth tokens are received THEN they SHALL be stored using the same secure storage mechanism as other credentials
2. WHEN OAuth authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL only request necessary permissions/scopes
3. WHEN OAuth tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle refresh automatically when possible
4. WHEN OAuth authentication fails due to security reasons THEN the system SHALL log the attempt for monitoring
5. WHEN a user revokes OAuth access externally THEN the system SHALL handle the revocation gracefully

### Requirement 6: Backend OAuth Support

**User Story:** As a system, I need backend support for OAuth authentication, so that I can validate and manage OAuth-authenticated users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives an OAuth token THEN it SHALL validate the token with the respective provider
2. WHEN OAuth validation is successful THEN the backend SHALL issue standard JWT tokens for the session
3. WHEN OAuth user information is received THEN the backend SHALL create or update user profiles appropriately
4. WHEN OAuth authentication occurs THEN the backend SHALL log the authentication event for audit purposes
5. WHEN OAuth provider APIs are called THEN the backend SHALL handle rate limits and errors appropriately

### Requirement 7: User Experience and UI

**User Story:** As a user, I want the OAuth sign-in interface to be intuitive and consistent with platform conventions, so that I feel confident using it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL follow platform-specific design guidelines
2. WHEN OAuth flow is initiated THEN the user SHALL see appropriate loading states and progress indicators
3. WHEN OAuth is completed THEN the user SHALL be smoothly transitioned to the main app interface
4. WHEN OAuth fails THEN the error messages SHALL be user-friendly and actionable
5. WHEN multiple OAuth options are available THEN they SHALL be presented in a clear, organized manner

### Requirement 8: Migration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to be able to add OAuth sign-in to my existing account, so that I can benefit from the convenience without losing my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing users update the app THEN they SHALL be able to add OAuth sign-in to their accounts
2. WHEN OAuth is added to an existing account THEN all existing data and settings SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN users have both email/password and OAuth THEN they SHALL be able to use either method to sign in
4. WHEN the OAuth integration is deployed THEN existing authentication methods SHALL continue to work without interruption
5. WHEN users migrate to OAuth THEN they SHALL have the option to keep or remove their password authentication
